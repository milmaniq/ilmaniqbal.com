                <p>
                    Data is migrated from one system to another using data pipelines.
                    Data pipeline is a way for moving data from a source to a destination while transforming
                    it.
                    Imagine, you want to move data from MySQL to Snowflake, then MySQL is the source and
                    Snowflake is the destination.
                    In Snowflake, raw data from the pipeline is loaded into a staging table and then
                    inserted into a final table.
                    This final table would be the destination of the pipeline.

                        <p>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is
                            commonly used for Online Transaction Processing (OLTP).</p>

                        <p>
                            OLTP databases are designed to handle a large volume of transactions with
                            concurrency control. Transactions are operations that modify data, such as
                            INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements.</p>

                        <p>
                            CDC is a method of extracting data from a database. CDC works by reading changes
                            using the MySQL Binary Log. To enable Binary Log in MySQL, you must add the
                            following lines under [mysqld] section to the MySQL config file, usually located
                            at <code>/etc/my.cnf</code> or <code>/etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf</code> or
                            <code>/etc/mysql/my.cnf</code> or
                            <code>/etc/mysql.cnf</code>:

                            After making the above change, remember to restart the MySQL server as: sudo

                            Airbyte is an integration platform designed to build data pipelines and
                            replicate data from a source to a destination. Using Airbyte, you have control
                            over how often your data syncs, what specific data gets replicated, and the way
                            it's stored in the destination. It's all about simplifying the task of moving
                            and organizing data, especially for analytics and business insights.

                    <li>
                        <p>In the ‘Define Source’ step, select the option to ‘Set up a new source’ and

                            sync for this connection needs to be carried out – scheduled, manual or cron).
                            You must also select the tables that need to be replicated and you must select
                            the sync modes that must be used for each table for replication. (More details
                            on the sync modes are given later in this article).</p>

                    Limitations

                <ul class="ml-5">
                    <li id="bold-font">Large Data Sync Limitations</li>
                    <p>Syncing data from a MySQL source to a Snowflake destination using Airbyte could lead
                        to failures during the sync process due to various factors such as network speeds
                        and system performance. The amount of data being transferred over the network,
                        coupled with the processing power required by both the source and destination
                        systems, can strain resources and potentially result in timeouts or failures. It's
                        crucial to consider optimizing network infrastructure, increasing system resources,
                        or implementing data partitioning strategies to mitigate these limitations and
                        ensure successful data synchronization. </p>

                    <li id="bold-font">Connectivity Restrictions</li>
                    <p>In some cases, Airbyte may not be directly allowed to establish connections to the
                        MySQL source due to regional or organizational restrictions. These restrictions
                        could be enforced by network firewalls, security policies, or access controls
                        implemented by the organization hosting the MySQL database. To overcome this
                        limitation, it may be necessary to work closely with network administrators or IT
                        security teams to whitelist Airbyte's IP addresses, configure VPN access, or explore
                        alternative connectivity options such as SSH tunneling, or deploying Airbyte within
                        the same network environment as the MySQL source or export tables from the MySQL
                        source into files, which can then be transferred to the Snowflake destination for
                        synchronization. By addressing these connectivity restrictions, organizations can
                        ensure seamless data flow between MySQL and Snowflake through Airbyte while
                        maintaining compliance with security policies and regulations.</p>
